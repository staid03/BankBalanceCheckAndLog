# BankBalanceCheckAndLog<br>
Personalised script to check and log my current bank balance. All details redacted.<br>
<br>
Note: Identifying bank details have been removed.<br>
		This is a personal use script uploaded to demonstrate my coding.<br>
		This was created in about 90 mins this morning (13th September 2017)<br>
		after I woke up.<br>
		I was thinking about a problem, last week, where I wanted to be able<br>
		to pull up my current bank balance quickly each day. I am not sure this<br>
		is the solution I need but it was a good idea to flesh out and it was<br>
		fun to code.<br>
